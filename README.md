- ❤️ **Healthbar ESP:** Visual healthbar for every player at the side of their character.
- 📏 **Distance ESP:** See the exact distance (in studs) to every player below their character.
- 🐇 **Bunnyhop (AutoJump):** Hold SPACE to automatically jump as soon as possible, for smooth movement (just like CS:GO bunnyhop).

- ⚡ **Super Smooth:** All visuals are updated in real time with no stuck ESP, no ghost objects, and no FPS drops.
- 🔄 **Event-Driven:** ESP creates/removes visuals only on join, leave, death, or respawn – not every frame.

2. **Load the script in your executor:**  
   Paste and run this in your executor's console:
   ```lua
   loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ljashub/bloxstrike-beta/refs/heads/main/main"))()
   ```

3. **Join [OPEN TESTING] BloxStrike**

## ❓ FAQ

- **Q: Does this ESP include Box ESP, Weapon ESP, Teamcheck or Tracers?**  
  **A:** No – this script is intentionally lightweight and only includes:
  - Nametag ESP
  - Healthbar ESP
  - Distance ESP
  - Bunnyhop
  - Speed indicator

- **Q: Is it safe? Will I get kicked?**  
  **A:** This script is designed to be as safe as possible.  
  It only creates/destroys ESP objects on player-related events (not every frame), keeping your session smooth and undetected in most games.  
  For best safety, always use a reputable executor like **XENO** (not Hydrogen, not KRNL, not random free executors).

- **Q: Can I customize the script?**  
  **A:** You can edit the code, but the public version does **NOT** include weapon, box, teamcheck, or tracer ESP.
